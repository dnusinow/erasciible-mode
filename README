eRASCIIble Minor Mode For Emacs

This minor mode is meant to pair with both ESS and Adoc modes for
handling R and ASCIIdoc files respectively. Using the outstanding
knitr R package, these two file types can be associated in a literate
programming style. Traditionally, you would write a single file with
blocks of alternating code and text. While emacs can support this with
one of several modes, I personally find it more comfortable right now
to keep the two separate while things are developing.

This mode assumes that for any given analysis you have both a .R and
.Rasciidoc file with the same prefix name. These two will eventually
be knit together by knitr. This mode provides functions for creating
both of these files at once, inserting and jumping between knitr
blocks, including between the paired files, and adding missing blocks
from the R file to the Rasciidoc one.
